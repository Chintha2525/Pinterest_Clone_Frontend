# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Creating a Pinterest clone involves implementing various features. 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://pinterest-clone-2525.netlify.app](https://pinterest-clone-2525.netlify.app) to view it in your browser.

## Here are some general components and features you are include in my Pinterest clone project:

## Frontend Integration

### Pins

Display pins (images) on the main feed.

Each pins should have an image, title, description, link, tags and comments.

### Pin Creation

Allow users to create a new pins.

Include a form for users to upload images, add titles, descriptions, and other relevant information.

### User Authentication

Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up, log in, and log out.

Secure certain features, such as pin creation, for authenticated users only.

### User Profile

Create user profiles where users can view and edit their information.

Display a collection of pins created by the user.

### Pin Exploration

Provide a page or feed for users to explore pins created by others.

Include categories or tags for easy navigation.

### Comments

Allow users to leave comments on pins.

Display comments below each pin.

### Likes

Implement a like or favorite system for users to express their appreciation for a pin.

Display the number of likes for each pin.

### Save Pins

Allow users to save pins to their profile or collections for future reference.

### Search

Implement a search functionality to allow users to find specific pins or topics.

### Responsive Design

Ensure that my application is responsive at desktop, providing a good user experience on desktop screen sizes.

### Settings

Create a settings page where users can manage account settings, logout and saved pins.

## Backend Integration

Implement a backend server to handle data storage, authentication, and other server-side logic.

Use a database to store user information, pins, comments, and other relevant data.

### Security

Implement security measures to protect user data, such as secure authentication practices and secure image handling.

### Error Handling

Provide error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful error messages to users.
